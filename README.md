# StackStore
Building an e-commerce store with a team of developers practicing AGILE &amp; RESTful development

StackStore is one of the first team projects that we work on as students of Fullstack Academy. 
The objective is to build an e-commerce website with Mongoose, Express, Angular, and Node.
Our group took an AGILE approach and divded the projects into feature slices. 

It was a great experience as we learned about the importance of using best practices and staying with the same coding conventions. 
In addition, we implemented a RESTful design pattern which made our coding far more predictable and readable.

We also wrote an extensive amount of back-end tests that started to break as we pivoted away from the initial scope.
This taught me an important lesson about writing good tests. In my opinion, tests should be geared towards core features.
As we developed the application, our goals started to change as we got a better sense of what we wanted to implement.
This caused issues with the tests we spent an extensive amount of time on. It simply did not compensate for the bigger picture.

Our team had a great time developing this website as we learned a great deal from each other.
